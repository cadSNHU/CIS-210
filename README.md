Course work from CIS-210 SHNU

Project 3: 
This project builds a program that allows a grocery store to input a file of data (items and quantity sold) and build reports based off it's contents. I have made generic changes to the program that allows for basic, minimal functionality and would like to add formatting for UX, better interface, fix a few bugs discovered and improve it's features. There are also things I can implement to enhance security such as with file import, efficiency, etc. 

While writing this tool, trying to build a histogram was the challenging part as I had to integrate with Python. It's much easier to build this type of display from Python, partially because I'm more comfortable with that language. However, many resources online helped me think through this process and figure out the best approach to manipulate the data. CPP documentation for functions and Stack Overflow were the resources that had the greatest impact. This type of troubleshooting and thinking through the program's flow will be used constantly and it's a great way to get more comfortable with the code. I have already used some of the techniques and thought process that I've gained from this project in my daily job. Specifically thinking about the overall flow and not just the next logical step which is something I've struggled with as I tend to focus too closely on the small details.
